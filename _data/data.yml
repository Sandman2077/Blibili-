    title: BIE别的与我
    summary: |
      我是刘寅韬，一名就读于悉尼大学数字传播与文化专业的研究生。在我学生生涯的最后一学期里，希望能够有机会在心仪的媒体公司中进行实习锻炼。鉴于离贵公司发布实习招聘信息已有个把月之久，我不确定目前是否还有相应的职位需求，因此我还是决定在自我个人能力称述后，于末尾将所有我提交申请的职位列出，并交由贵司判断。如有叨扰，请多包涵。
      
      我到底何时与 BIE别的 结缘的呢？每当思考起这个问题，我总是在纠结 是该从BIE别的 自己另起炉灶改弦易辙后才算起，还是要囊括进曾经作为 VICE中国 时期留给我的精神遗产， 思前想后也没个准确的答案。直到某天，我在油管看完一期VICE的视频，望着视频列表的标题发呆并沉浸在“what a shitty world"的低气压中时，惊觉平常通过微信公众号浏览的 BIE别的，似乎很久不曾让我感受到这种对世界苛责般审视的目光了。我意识到 此时此刻再去纠结于过往的关系着实有些愚蠢，此番行为无异于热恋期后对另一半的疑神疑鬼，围绕着 对方到底还是不是我一开始爱上的那个人这种恋爱脑问题 上演八点半抓马小剧场，然后逐步陷入到自我拧巴自我怀疑的环节。接受改变，或者转身离开。从改版后我每隔几天就点进主页巴拉简报的习惯来看，其实在心底早已给出了答案。大概是左派某种固有的批判性倾向--当然这是往好听了说，本质上也可能不过只是来自无能的理想主义者自身 愤世嫉俗般的narcissism的外溢，总想给这种改变挑刺儿然后煞有介事的感叹一句，变了，没那味儿了，XX一死，完成精神左派网上键政时的常规发言。还好当时我的脑子管住了躁动的双手，避免了将来被打脸的结局。从现在来看，这种改变无疑是令我欣喜的。即便今天再把 BIE别的 和 VICE放在一起比较，我依旧偏爱于 BIE别的 的调性--保持着对社会敏锐观察的同时，多了些个人视角下的温情，少了丝对世界荒诞的嘲弄。个体先锋性，这大概是我从BIE别的所领悟到的一个永恒的人生议题。与其困扰于世界该怎么样，不如即刻反观下自身与世界的关系。无论是绘画也好，音乐也好，写作也好，找到与世界相处的途径。不管是种族问题也好还是性别问题也罢，理清这些社会建构的概念对自己生命的意义。而来自 BIE别的 的内容，大概是赋予自身勇气并去尝试改变的最佳养料吧。

        Several friends and I launched an online trading software through the Wechat platform, which is targeted to the freshmen from all the colleges in our high educational district.
        We mainly sell some daily necessities and household appliances (like small refrigerators, washing machines and routers). My friends did programming and interactive design, and I was responsible for
        publicity and personnel management. It was the first time for me to experience and practice concepts unrelated to my major, 
        such as supply chain management, personnel recruitment, delivery, accounting and so on. Luckily, we didn't make any big mistakes and earned a fair amount of income in the end. It may not be a formal work experience, but I did learn a lot.

    title: Game Experience
    intro: >
      I would say I am quite omnivorous in terms of game genre. I was a huge fan of Pokemon since I was a child, while I also played the Red Alert series and StarCraft at that time. Then, I underwent my teenage years mainly with the company of League of Legends and Overwatch.
      I used to play Rainbow Six Seige; For Horner; The Division series; and most Ubisoft games. Now, Apex Legend is my staple. Of course, besides those long service-oriented games, I also had played GTA series, Red Dead Redemption, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and basically most of the famous games every year. The games that moved me the most in recent years were NieR: Automata, The Witcher 3, Cyberpunk 2077 and Disco Elysium. Frankly, I prefer to pay attention to the story and narrative rather than the design of the game mechanism, though I fully understand how fatal the game mechanism design it is.
      I wouldn't say I sink into social media platforms from day to night, but I do much care about the gamers community and know well about meme culture. Whenever there's a new launch or a hot event, I'm used to checking reviews from both the Chinese gaming community and the mainstream gaming circle in Europe and the US. I have accounts on Reddit and Discord, and also watch streaming on Twitch occasionally. I haven't played too many mobile games, so I am not really familiar with Taptap but I have a basic sense of it.
      I am also big fan of anime and manga, but I'm not sure what the requirement referring to here is in the broad concept of a pan-entertaining 二次元 or so-called 老二次元 of a bygone era.
      I haven't had an internship in the game industry so far, but the courses I've taken have included teaching game design, game audiences analysis, social media platforms analysis, social media campaign curating and other necessary skills for working in the industry.
      The following are some cards and mobile games that I've played and watched closely
